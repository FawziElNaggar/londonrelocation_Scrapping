using Python and Scrapy framework in Rentola and thus we are providing the basic structure for your to utilize the same tools to scrap the website.  Your goal is to be able to:  Traverse the areas with their links listed in this page https://londonrelocation.com/properties-to-rent/ such as Fulham, Canary Wharf Angel, and etc. (Already Implemented by us as an example) Visit each area link and traverse the paginated properties lists (page 1 and page 2 only are sufficient). Do not hard code the pages links in step2, scrap them from the area page from step1. For each property you need to save the property title, price per month, and property URL.
